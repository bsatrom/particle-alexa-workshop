# Extras: Going Even Further!

## Ideas for taking your exploration further!

Now that you've gotten a survey of all that the Particle ecosystem offers, why not try building a web, mobile, or cloud app to interact with your Particle device? Here are a couple of ideas to get your started, and links to some resources you might find helpful.

1. Play with [all those other Grove sensors in your Starter Kit](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/accessories/mesh-accessories/) and build something awesome!

2.  Create a Particle-powered mobile app using our [iOS](https://docs.particle.io/reference/ios/), [Android](https://docs.particle.io/reference/android/), and [Windows](https://docs.particle.io/reference/windows/) SDKs.

3.  Create a Particle-powered web app using the [Particle JS library](https://docs.particle.io/reference/javascript/) and your framework of choice, like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

4.  Create a Particle-powered cross-platform mobile app using [NativeScript and Vue.js](https://www.nativescript.org/vue).
